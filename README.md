Link To Live App: [FundIt!](https://fundit-aa-sf-may-19.herokuapp.com/#/login)


FundIt is a crowd-funding web application heavily based on Kickstarter. Here, innovators can share their work and raise the capital needed to launch their products. Users can back projects based on various reward levels. 

FundIt makes use of a Rails/PostgreSQL backend with React and Redux on the frontend. This single page web application was designed and developed within a two-week time period. I plan to implement a few more features down the line, such as search, category filtering, and implementation of a rich text editor.

## Features
* Implementation of frontend to backend user authentication using BCrypt
* Form to create projects made through standard React components. No use of any external libraries other than React for components.
* Users can back projects, create projects, and browse projects.
* Backing a project updates the database and creates an association between a reward, project, and user.
