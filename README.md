Link To Live App: [FundIt!](https://fundit-aa-sf-may-19.herokuapp.com/#/login)


FundIt is a crowd-funding web application heavily based on Kickstarter. Here, innovators can share their work and raise the capital needed to launch their products. Users can back projects based on various reward levels. 

FundIt makes use of a Rails/PostgreSQL backend with React and Redux on the frontend. This single page web application was designed and developed within a two-week time period. I plan to implement a few more features down the line, such as search and category filtering.
